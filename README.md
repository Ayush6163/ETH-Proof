#AryanToken
A simple Ethereum smart contract for managing a custom token named Aryan (AYUSH).

#Description
This Solidity smart contract defines the AryanToken, which is a basic implementation resembling an ERC-20 token. It allows minting of new tokens and burning existing tokens based on specified conditions. The contract maintains records of token balances for each address and tracks the total token supply.


#Installing
To interact with this smart contract.

A development environment with a Solidity compiler (version 0.8.18 or compatible).
Use Remix Online Ethereum IDE.
An interface to interact with Ethereum contracts 

#Executing program
     To deploy and use the contract:

i. Clone the repository or copy the Solidity code into your development environment.
ii. Compile the Solidity code using your preferred Solidity compiler.
iii. Deploy the compiled contract to an Ethereum network or local blockchain.


#Help
For any issues or questions:

Double-check contract parameters and function calls for accurate execution.
